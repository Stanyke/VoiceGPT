This is a Nodejs (for API) and Reactjs (for UI) app that helps transcribe audio files to text and equally makes further searches on the text from the audio and gives you a response, with some additional features for swift functionality with the help of OpenAI.

<b><u>How To Run App</u></b>

- Since both the backend and frontend applications run concurrently, I've added the script command to do the setup on a go.
- It's best you cd into the backend and frontend folder and runs the command to install the dependencies respectively when working on your local machine.
- The <code>_npm run start_</code> command (on the root directory of the app) can install all dependencies and start-up both apps. This is mainly useful when the app is being deployed.
- The <code>_npm run dev_</code> command (on the root directory of the app) is able to start up both apps without installation. So, I would recommend making use of this in the development mode since you've installed all the dependencies, also make sure all dependencies are installed before running this command.
